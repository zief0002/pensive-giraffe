    "text": "The goal of this assignment is to give you experience using matrix algebra to compute various analytic output for regression. In this assignment, you will use the data given below that includes measurements for 10 countries on: infant mortality rate per 1000 live births (infant), the per-capita income (pci) and world region (region) of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\ncountry\ninfant\npci\nregion\n\n\n\n\nAlgeria\n86.3\n400\nAfrica\n\n\nBolivia\n60.4\n200\nAmericas\n\n\nBurundi\n150.0\n68\nAfrica\n\n\nDominican Republic\n48.8\n406\nAmericas\n\n\nKenya\n55.0\n169\nAfrica\n\n\nMalawi\n148.3\n130\nAfrica\n\n\nNicaragua\n46.0\n507\nAmericas\n\n\nParaguay\n38.6\n347\nAmericas\n\n\nRwanda\n132.9\n61\nAfrica\n\n\nTrinidad & Tobago\n26.2\n732\nAmericas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\nSubmit a printed document of your responses to the following questions. Please adhere to the following guidelines for further formatting your assignment:\n\nAll plots should be resized so that they do not take up more room than necessary.\nAll figures and tables should have a name (e.g., Figure 1) and an appropriate caption.\n\nIn questions that ask you to “use matrix algebra” to solve the problem, you can either show your syntax and output from carrying out the matrix operations, or you can use Equation Editor to input the matrices involved in your calculations.\nThis assignment is worth 20 points.\n\n\n\nUnstandardized Regression\nYou will be fitting the model lm(infant ~ 1 + pci + region + pci:region). Within this model, use dummy coding to encode the region predictor and make Americas the reference group.\n\nWrite out the elements of the matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\intercal}\\mathbf{X}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is the design matrix.\nDoes \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\intercal}\\mathbf{X}\\) have an inverse? Explain.\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the vector of coefficients, b for the OLS regression.\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the variance–covariance matrix of the coefficients.\nUse the values from b (Question 3) and from the variance–covariance matrix you reported in the previous question to find the 95% CI for the coefficient associated with the main-effect of PCI. (Hint: If you need to refresh yourself on how CIs are computed, see here.)\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the hat-matrix, H. Also show how you would use the values in the hat-matrix to find \\(\\hat{y}_1\\) (the predicted value for Algeria).\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the vector of residuals, e.\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the estimated value for the RMSE.\nGiven the assumptions of the OLS model and the RMSE estimate you computed in the previous question, compute and report the variance–covariance matrix of the residuals.\n\n\n\n\nANOVA Decomposition\nIn this section you will be re-creating the output from the ANOVA decomposition for the model fitted in the previous section.\n\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the model, residual, and total sum of squares terms in the ANOVA decomposition table. (2pts)\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the model, residual, and total degrees of freedom terms in the ANOVA decomposition table. (2pts)\nUse the values you obtained in Questions 11 and 12 to compute the model and residual mean square terms.\nUse the mean square terms you found in Question 13 to compute the F-value for the model (i.e., to test \\(H_0:\\rho^2=0\\)). Also compute the p-value associated with this F-value. (Hint: If you need to refresh yourself on how F-values or p-values are computed, see here.)\n\n\n\n\nRegression: Effects-Coding\nNow consider fitting the model to the data to examine whether there is an effect of region (no other predictors) on infant mortality. In this model, we will use effects-coding to encode the region variable (see here). This model is often expressed as:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{Infant~Mortality}_i = \\mu + \\alpha_{\\mathrm{Region}} + \\epsilon_i\n\\]\n\nWrite out the design matrix that would be used to fit this model.\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the vector of coefficients, b, from the OLS regression.\nCompute (using matrix algebra) and report the variance–covariance matrix for the coefficients.\nExplain why the sampling variances for the coefficients are the same and why the sampling covariance is zero by referring to computations produced in the matrix algebra.

For this simulation use a sample size of 200.\n\nCreate the fixed X values you will use in each trial of the simulation. To do this, draw \\(n=200\\) X-values from a uniform distribution with a minimum of \\(-2\\) and a maximum of \\(+2\\). Prior to drawing these values, set your starting seed to 678910. Report the syntax you used, and the first six X values.\nCreate a the Y-values for the first trial of the simulation by using the model:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\ny_i &= -3.2 + 1.75(x_i) + \\epsilon_i \\\\[2ex]\n\\epsilon_i &\\overset{i.i.d.}{\\sim} \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\nwhere\n\n\\[\n\\begin{split}\n\\sigma &= e^{\\gamma(x_i)}\\\\[2ex]\ne &\\mathrm{~is~Euhler's~constant~}(\\approx2.718282) \\\\[2ex]\n\\gamma &= 1.5\n\\end{split}\n\\]\n\nHere the variation in the random error is a function of X and random noise.

Explain.\n\nCarry out 1000 trials of the simulation. (Reminder: Be sure to use these same X values in each trial of the simulation; they are fixed.) For each trial, collect: (a) the estimate of the intercept, (b) the estimate of the slope, and (c) the estimate of the residual standard error.\n\nCompute and report the mean value for the residual standard error.\n\n\n\n\nSimulation 2: Homoskedastic Model\nTo evaluate the different estimates from the heteroskedasticity model, we need to compare them to estimates drawn from a homoskedastic model with the same population coefficients. To make the comparisons “fair”, so that we are only evaluating the effects of the heteroskedasticity, we also need to run this simulation using a residual standard error that is equal to the mean from the heteroskedastic simulation (i.e., \\(\\mathtt{sd\\neq1}\\) in the rnorm() function).\n\nCarry out 1000 trials of the simulation for the appropriate homoskedastic model. (Reminder: Be sure to use these same X values in this simulation as in the previous simulation.) For each trial, collect: (a) the estimate of the intercept, (b) the estimate of the slope, and (c) the estimate of the residual standard error. Report your syntax.\n\n\n\n\nComparing Results from the Two Simulations: Evaluating the Effects of Hetroskedasticity\n\nCreate a density plot of the distribution of intercept estimates. Show the density curve for both models on the same plot, differentiating the curves using color, linetype, or both. Also add a vertical line to this plot at the population value of the intercept.\nBased on your responses to Question 8, does the intercept estimate seem to be biased under heteroskedasticity? Explain.\nBased on your responses to Question 8, does the intercept estimate seem to be less efficient under heteroskedasticity? Explain.\nCreate a density plot of the distribution of slope estimates. Show the density curve for both models on the same plot, differentiating the curves using color, linetype, or both. Also add a vertical line to this plot at the population value of the slope\nBased on your responses to Question 11, does the slope estimate seem to be biased under heteroskedasticity? Explain.\nBased on your responses to Question 11, does the slope estimate seem to be less efficient under heteroskedasticity? Explain.\nCreate a density plot of the distribution of residual standard error estimates. Show the density curve for both models on the same plot, differentiating the curves using color, linetype, or both. Also add a vertical line to this plot at the population value of the residual standard error\nBased on your responses to Question 14, does the residual standard error estimate seem to be biased under heteroskedasticity? Explain.\nBased on your responses to Question 14, does the residual standard error estimate seem to be less efficient under heteroskedasticity? Explain."

Are there observations that look problematic in these plots? If so, identify the country(ies).\nFit the regression model (specified in the introduction) to the data. Report the fitted equation.\nCreate and include a set of plots that allow you to examine the assumptions for linear regression. Based on these plots, comment on the tenability of these assumptions.\n\n\n\n\nOutliers, Leverage, and Influence\n\nCompute the externally studentized residuals for the observations based on the fitted regression. Based on these values, identify any countries that you would consider as regression outliers.

Report the coefficient-level output (B, SE, t, and p) for this model.\nFind (and report) the Bonferroni adjusted p-value for the observation with the largest absolute studentized residual. Based on this p-value, is there statistical evidence to call this observation a regression outlier? Explain.\nCreate and include an index plot of the leverage values.

Explain how you decided on this set of observations.\nRemove the observations you identified in Question #12 from the data and refit the regression model omitting these observations. Report the fitted equation.\nCreate and include a set of plots that allow you to examine the assumptions for linear regression. Based on these plots, comment on the tenability of these assumptions.\nCompare and contrast the coefficient-level inferences from the model fitted with the full data and that fitted with the omitted observations.\nCompare and contrast the model-level summaries, namely \\(R^2\\) and the RMSE, from the model fitted with the full data and that fitted with the omitted observations."
